# Welcome

This is a personal webpage that contains a portfolio of my work, which includes software, presentations and papers, as well as musical performances and compositions. If you would like to contact me, please send an email to ryan[at]foxdot[dot]org.

For a full list of my software repositories, see [my dedicated software development GitHub account](http://github.com/qirky/).

## Software

### FoxDot

FoxDot is a Python library for [live coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) music with a focus on object-oriented programming practices. It uses the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) audio engine to generate sound by sending messages via Open Sound Control (OSC). Users take control of "Players" and allocate instructions, such as pitch and duration, and can change these instructions algorithmically in time. What started as a personal experiment has now become a tool used by live coders from all over the world.

### Troop

During my PhD studies I have been researching methods for collaboration in live coding music and it has led me to develop several GUIs for joint working across a network. The first interface I developed was Troop; a real-time concurrent multi-user editor for live coding, similar in style to Google Docs. Multiple users can  connect to a Troop server and start  working on the same body of code using a variety of different live  coding environments including [FoxDot](https://www.foxdot.org/), [TidalCycles](http://tidalcycles.org), [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), and [Sonic-Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

### CodeBank

This collaborative live coding interface (still in development) gives users a local workspace to experiment in before 'pushing' their code to a server that is generating audio for an audience. It is part of ongoing research into public and private working in digital music creation in the context of live coding.

## Music

I perform music as solo act under the moniker of Qirky, creating a blend of melodic techno, deep house, and electro-pop using FoxDot. I have performed at several [Algorave] events across the UK, including Green Man and Shambala festivals, and also at international events.

[Webpage for Qirky](http://qirky.github.io/)

I also perform with an experimental/electronic group of live coders called The Yorkshire Programming Ensemble (TYPE) using Troop to collaborate with code in FoxDot.
