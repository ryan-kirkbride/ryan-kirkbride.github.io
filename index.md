## Music

I perform as solo act under the moniker of [Qirky](http://qirky.github.io/), creating a blend of melodic techno, deep house, and electro-pop using FoxDot. I also perform in a experimental/electronic group of live coders called The Yorkshire Programming Ensemble ([TYPE](https://typeensemble.wordpress.com/)) using Troop to collaborate with code in FoxDot.
